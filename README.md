# How to become a software developer

There are various ways to get into software development, so it can be hard to know where to even start. Here's my suggested, general approach:

1.	Complete [CS50 Understanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology) (not essential but a great way to ease into tech from a non-technical background)
2.	Start with the first [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) course listed, and work through it (the first 1-3 courses would be a fantastic start)
3.	Do [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) alongside the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) work
4.	If you’re hooked at this point, you can keep going with more [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) courses or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) ones, depending on your interests, and try to build your own projects (best way to learn) and add them to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) portfolio (best way to show what you’ve learned, and get a job), or look at a [Springboard course](https://springboardcourses.ie/login) if you want to get a formal qualification
5.  Ensure you have a couple of projects you can talk about in an interview - the best projects are ones that solve a problem (you can find some advice on this [here](https://twitter.com/DThompsonDev/status/1621892116937834500))

It is essential to consistently network, and to add code to GitHub as you learn. Even from the first bits of code you write, these can be added to GitHub to practise using GitHub and writing code regularly. Once a bit more familiar with coding and using GitHub, a huge bonus, if possible, would be to learn a bit about how to review code in general and on GitHub, and to get your code reviewed by someone else learning to code, or to review someone's code on GitHub, and to show that you are able to use GitHub in this way. Code reviews are a big part of software development but are often not covered in college courses.

## Resources for people interested in studying software development (or getting into tech)

### [Springboard](https://springboardcourses.ie/login)
Springboard is an excellent resource for longer-term college courses (free or you pay 10% of the fee) – generally conversion courses to transition to tech – lots of part-time and online options to facilitate working full-time at the same time - this is how I moved from my languages and customer support background to become a full-time software developer.

### [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)
[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) is a brilliant free introduction to computer science from Harvard – most people in my software development diploma supplemented their learning with this and it’s the main course I recommend to people moving to software development ([CS50 Understanding Technology](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-understanding-technology) is a nice course that could be done first to ease into it from a non-technical background).

### [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/?src=sac&kw=web+develop)
Web development is a great topic to study at first if interested in transitioning to software development, and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) has loads of great courses which get discounted to about €13 every few days so you can just wait for a sale and sign up at that price.

### [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn)
This is a brilliant starting point for learning software development.

### [Codecademy's Sorting Quiz](https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz)
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is similar to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) but not all of it is free, so I would not use it as a main resource, however, [this sorting quiz](https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz) is useful for getting an idea of if you’d be suited to becoming a software engineer, UX designer, product owner or project manager, etc.

### [eCollege](https://www.ecollege.ie/)
[eCollege](https://www.ecollege.ie/) has some thorough free courses, e.g. in Java and Python, but also the likes of Photoshop and Microsoft Office – aimed at people working full-time.
